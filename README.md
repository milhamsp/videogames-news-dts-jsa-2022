# videogames-news-dts-jsa-2022
This repository contains my little project to accomplish my final project assignment in Digital Talent Scholarship "JavaScript with API" program by Kominfo and Progate in 2022. This project were created with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap 5.1 and [Videogames NEWS API](https://rapidapi.com/danielilieprojects-G7QdvK7X5Ao/api/videogames-news2/) by Daniel Ilie from [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/hub). The result of this project is web-based functional news app that can share latest videogames news and search for specific videogames news. However there are some minor problems because I use basic subscription and sometime the news search features doesn't work because of API request quota limit.
